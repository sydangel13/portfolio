    <h1> About Sydney </h1>
    <p> I am a first year Master's student at the University of Michigan studying User Experience Research and Design with a primary focus in research and content strategy.<br>
        <br>
        I am incredibly passionate about creating digital content that is easily accessible to all types of users, through empathetic design solutions and personal adaptability. 
        Ultimately, I hope to plan and develop clear, relevant content that aligns with the user's needs, as well as the business goals.
        I strive to accomplish this through flushed-out research and analysis. <br>
        <br>
    <p> I previously graduated from the University of Michigan, where I double-majored in Biopsychology, Cognition and Neuroscience and Cognitive Science with a focus in decision-making. 
        In my free time I enjoy playing with my six month old golden-doodle, watching Broadway musicals, hiking through national parks and listening to True Crime podcasts. </p>
