                <h2> Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this assignment was to create six minimalistic weather screens using a combination
                        of Photoshop and Illustrator. <br> <br>
                        In order to create these designs, I used various combinations of my own created shapes, and images 
                        curated from reusable sources. <br> <br>
                        Color was implemented in this design to give the user a sense of time of day, weather and general 
                        location. <br>
                    </p>
                <h3> Project Process</h3>
                    <p>Before designing the weather states, I first did some preliminary research of 
                        current minimalistic weather apps to see what they looked like. After getting a good idea 
                        of what the competitors were doing, I create several sketches covering different iterations of 
                        what I wanted the application to look like. <br> <br>
                        Once I created a design I was happy with, I started wireframing and creating a barebones example of 
                        what the designs looked like in my head. <br> <br>
                        Once the wireframe was done, I decided to create color palettes using the online tool Adobe Color. <br> <br>
                        After selecting the colors I would use for the design, I began creating each screen.
